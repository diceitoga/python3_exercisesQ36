    "Ex 36 Plotting....Last exercise!! \n",
    " Birthday Plots\n",
    "Exercise 36 (and Solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is Part 4 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. \n",
    "The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise we counted how many birthdays there are in each month in our dictionary of birthdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, use the bokeh Python library to plot a histogram of which months the scientists have birthdays in! \n",
    "Because it would take a long time for you to input the months of various scientists, \n",
    "you can use my scientist birthday JSON file. Just parse out the months\n",
    "(if you don’t know how, I suggest looking at the previous exercise or its solution) and draw your histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a purely web-based interface for coding, \n",
    "this exercise won’t work for you, since it requires installing the bokeh Python package. \n",
    "Now might be a good time to install Python on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Today’s topic is going to be about the bokeh plotting library. \n",
    "We create plots and charts to display and communicate information from data, \n",
    "and it would be great to do that directly from Python. \n",
    "Sometimes it is really nice to write code or algorithms from scratch to learn and practice, \n",
    "and sometimes, someone has already written the code so well that you should use theirs. \n",
    "Bokeh is one of these libraries - it is library specifically with functions \n",
    "for making plots, charts, and graphs. \n",
    "It is based on the famous D3.js library originally developed at the New York Times for their visualizations, \n",
    "which has been used for many years to programmatically create visually appealing data visualizations.\n",
    "When to make plots\n",
    "\n",
    "We use plots to convey information. From this histogram:\n",
    "You can immediately see that the US government spending has been steadily increasing, reaching a peak in January 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "So learning how to make plots will help you become better at displaying and communicating information, \n",
    "both to yourself and to others.\n",
    "Plotting libraries in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for a plotting library in Python, you have two main options: \n",
    "matplotlib and bokeh. Today I want to discuss bokeh, because I think it will become more popular in years to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Python developers (and especially data scientists and researchers) \n",
    "will tell you that the most commonly used plotting library in Python is matplotlib. \n",
    "I myself was a matplotlib user for many years - the integrations with Python data libraries are great, \n",
    "and migrating from the MATLAB plotting environment to matplotlib is easy. \n",
    "But a friend introduced me to bokeh and I was hooked ever since. \n",
    "Because it is based on D3.js, the visualizations look smooth and professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no one “best” plotting library - you should use whichever one feels and looks better for you. \n",
    "But for the rest of this post, I’ll talk about how to use bokeh to make a basic plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing bokeh\n",
    "\n",
    "To use bokeh, we first have to install it. Unlike something like json or Counter from previous exercises, bokeh does not come installed with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using the Anaconda Python distribution (which you should, if you are on Windows!) then you can install bokeh by typing\n",
    "\n",
    "conda install bokeh\n",
    "\n",
    "in the Windows command prompt or the bash shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "On OSX or GNU / Linux, just type\n",
    "\n",
    "pip3 install bokeh\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you have are using Python 2, you should do pip install bokeh.)\n",
