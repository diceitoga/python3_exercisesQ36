# python3_exercisesQ36
36 PythonQuestionsFrom https://www.practicepython.org/exercises/  Last few 10 or so are really useful with JSON, os, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, numpy and bokeh Moduless 
These exerciese are good in learning functions, I/O, simple DataFrame manipulation, series and arrays in combination with list, truples etc. 
There is some plotting using bokeh at the end which is also interesting.  
What it does not get into are more advanced topics in OOP, decorators, or web framework like Django or Flask, but is a good intro into
Pandas, Numpy, Beautifulsoup, JSON, os, and is a good entry point for Data Analytics.   The data analysis in these exerciese do not use
database either, and mainly use reading in files, into DataFrame, manipulating data using rows/columns, via index, list etc, accepting
additional user input, then plotting (very end at #36).
